CRITICAL:
 1. keep API key in an env section
 2. separate the functions and put into their own files

TODO:
 1. get RDS to work
 2. Virustotal working

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
 1. CLI input of dirs to scan


How do I get the Virustotal to work?

option A. Create a shell command based on the ouput

option B. use it out of python

how do i bypass the api limit?
can i send multiple hashes or a zip file to count as one?
